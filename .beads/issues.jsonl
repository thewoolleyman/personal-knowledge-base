{"id":"personal-knowledge-base-59n","title":"Add version management for release tagging","description":"Decide and implement version source for the release workflow. Options: (a) tag-based releases where pushing a v* tag triggers release, (b) a VERSION file in repo root that the release workflow reads and auto-tags. The reference project reads version from manifest.json and auto-bumps after release. For our Go CLI, recommend tag-based (push v1.0.0 tag triggers release) since it is the standard Go convention. Add ldflags to inject version into the binary at build time (e.g. -ldflags \"-X main.version=$VERSION\"). Add a 'make version' target.","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","owner":"thewoolleyman@gmail.com","created_at":"2026-02-01T01:59:09.789586-08:00","created_by":"Chad Woolley","updated_at":"2026-02-01T02:27:03.539564-08:00","closed_at":"2026-02-01T02:27:03.539564-08:00","close_reason":"Implemented CI, release, and auto-merge workflows with version management"}
